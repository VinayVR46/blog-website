                 <p class="first-paragraph"> <strong> Artificial Intelligence </strong> has captured the imagination and attention of people globally. 
                    But in the business world, the rate of adoption of artificial 
                    intelligence has lagged behind the level of interest through 2019. 
                    Even though we hear that most business leaders believe AI provides a competitive advantage, 
                    up until recnently, some industry watchers have pegged enterprise adoption at less than 20%.
                 </p>
                <p>But as we enter 2020, we‚Äôre spotting an uptick, not only in interest but in AI adoption. And that uptick is reaffirmed by a recent global survey commissioned by IBM. 
                    The survey, From Roadblock to Scale: The Global Sprint Towards AI, polled more than 
                     4,500 technology decision makers. We wanted to gauge the current and future states of AI deployment across 
                     the U.S., Europe and China, to better understand the landscape and the challenges. 
                     As youll see, its about to change dramatically.

                <h2>AI Adoption on the Rise </h2>
                   <p> Results from the Roadblocks to Scale survey indicate that while there is still work to be done, advances in data discovery and management, skills training and AI explainability are driving the rate of AI adoption faster than many predicted.
                     For example, 45% of the respondents from large companies (1,000+ employees) said they have adopted AI, while 29% of small and medium sized businesses (under 1,000 employees) responding said they have adopted the technology. These numbers are significantly higher than some industry watchers have estimated to date. Some of the more telling data points of the survey, for which the Executive Summary can be found here, include the following:
                   </p>
                    <p> A Glimpse at the Numbers</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><p><strong>Skills</strong>:- Major roadblocks are still holding companies back from the benefits of AI. Amongst respondents, 37% cite limited AI expertise or knowledge as a hinderance from successful AI adoption at their business, with increasing data complexities and siloed data (31%) and lack of tools for developing AI models (26%) following close behind.</li>
                        </p>
                    <li><strong>Trust</strong>. Trust is part of the bedrock of AI deployment. Globally, 78% of respondents across all countries surveyed say it is very or critically important that they can trust that their AI‚Äôs output is fair, safe, and reliable. Moreover, being able to explain how AI arrived at a decision is universally important (83% of global respondents).</li> 
                    <li><strong>Data</strong>. Companies currently deploying AI technologies are more likely to use a hybrid cloud (38% adopted) or hybrid multicloud (17% adopted), as AI success is fed by data. And, data is everywhere, on all clouds.</li>
                </ul>
